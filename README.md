The data i will use for this task provides information on over 1,000 unicorn companies, including their industry, country, year founded, and select investors. i will use this information to gain insights into how and when companies reach this prestigious milestone and to make recommendations for next steps to the investing firm.





FINDINGS:........
There are 1074 unicorn companies represented in this dataset.
Some companies took longer to reach unicorn status but have accrued high valuation as of March 2022. Companies could take longer to achieve unicorn status for a number of reasons, including requiring more funding or taking longer to develop a business model.



RECOMENDATION:.....
Identify the main industries that the investing firm is interested in investing in.
Select a subset of this data that includes only companies in those industries.
Analyze that subset more closely. Determine which companies have higher valuation but do not have as many investors currently. They may be good candidates to consider investing in.
